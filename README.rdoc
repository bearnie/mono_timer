# Mono Timer

An Pomodoro-style 25:00 minutes timer application with notification feature. It's built with Ruby on Rails.

The main purpose of the development is learning about Ruby on Rails through actual applications rather than a sample code.

The wiki page would become the storage for what I learned or struggled.
