Pomodoro-style 25 minutes timer application with notification feature. It's built with Ruby on Rails. It supports e-mail notification through [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/) and push-notification through [Pushover](https://pushover.net/).

The main purpose of the development is learning about Ruby on Rails through actual applications rather than a sample code.
